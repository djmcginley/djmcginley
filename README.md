- Next, I went on to Singularity University where I started the Business Intelligence department from scratch and focused my team's efforts on Marketing optimization and Product Engagement.
- From there, I went to ForeScout Technologies as the Global Sales Operations Analyst to craft a data driven strategy that would increase our Fortune 100 penetration rate.
- After that, I helped SlingTV increase adoption of their flagship product over 50% during the pandemic.
- Next, I got an opporunity to lead the Strategic Analytics department at Rachio where I led a team to build an end to end reporting db that supplied all insights and analytics for C-Suite and Board meetings.
- Finally, I've been spending the last 3 years at Burner, building a world class Analytics and BI dept that supports RevOps, Marketing, Product, and Experimentation efforts.
