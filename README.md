📖 My Story
- In 2014 I landed my first job as an entry level data analyst for a market research firm combining stats and market data to drive decision making for executive audiences at Intel, HP, Google, IBM, etc.
- Next, I went on to Singularity University where I started the Business Intelligence department from scratch and focused my team's efforts on Marketing optimization and Product Engagement.
- From there, I went to ForeScout Technologies as the Global Sales Operations Analyst to craft a data driven strategy that would increase our Fortune 100 penetration rate.
- After that, I helped SlingTV increase adoption of their flagship product over 50% during the pandemic.
- Next, I got an opporunity to lead the Strategic Analytics department at Rachio where I led a team to build an end to end customer data platform that supplied all insights and analytics for C-Suite and Board meetings.
- Finally, I've been spending the last 3 years at Burner, building a world class Analytics and BI dept and with our data, we've increased ARR over 75% and new cohort LTV over 33%.

In my spare time, you'll find me snowboarding, hiking, and exploring new restaurants (obsessed over tacos).
