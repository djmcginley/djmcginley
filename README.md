- In 2014 I landed my first job as a data analyst for a market research firm combining stats and market data to drive decision making for executive audiences at Intel, HP, Google, IBM, etc.
- Next, I went on to Singularity University where I started the Business Intelligence department from scratch and focused my team's efforts on Marketing optimization and Product Engagement.
- From there, I went to ForeScout Technologies as the Global Sales Operations Analyst to craft a data driven strategy that would increase our Fortune 100 penetration rate by 27%.
- During the Pandemic, I helped SlingTV increase adoption of their flagship product by over 50%.
- After that, I got an opporunity to lead the Strategic Analytics department at Rachio where I led a team to build an entire end to end reporting db that supplied all insights and analytics for C-Suite and Board meetings.
- Finally, I've spent the last 3 years at Burner, building a world class Analytics and BI dept that supports RevOps, Marketing, Product, and Experimentation efforts.
